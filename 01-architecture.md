## System overview

dreyk is split into two apps sharing one backend:

- **PWA (`apps/web`)** — Next.js web app installable from the browser. Handles authenticated web workflows, admin routes, user routes, map operations, zone management, and module logic.
- **Companion (`apps/companion`)** — Minimal Expo React Native app. Single responsibility: capture GPS in background and POST coordinates to the API. Also receives push notifications.
- **Supabase** — Shared backend for both apps. Same project, same JWT, same database.

## Monorepo structure

One GitHub repository, two independent deploys.

```

**Golden rule:** features never import from each other. Anything shared moves to `packages/shared` (cross-app) or `apps/[app]/shared/` (within-app).

## Tech stack

### Web app — `apps/web`

| Layer | Tool | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 14 (App Router) | pages, routing, SSR |
| Map | mapcn (MapLibre) | zone map, live user markers |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | utility-first styling |
| State | Zustand | global state per feature slice |
| Server/cache | React Query (TanStack) | data fetching, cache, sync |
| Language | TypeScript strict | |

### Companion — `apps/companion`

| Layer | Tool | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Expo React Native + Expo Router | screens, navigation |
| GPS | expo-location + expo-task-manager | background location tracking |
| Notifications | Expo Notifications | FCM + APNs push |
| State | Zustand | minimal local state |
| Language | TypeScript strict | |

### Backend — Supabase (shared)

| Layer | Tool | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Auth | Supabase Auth (JWT) | login, session, RLS enforcement |
| Database | PostgreSQL | all persistent data |
| Realtime | Supabase Realtime | live user positions on map |
| Functions | Edge Functions (Deno) | Alexa trigger, push notify |
| Security | Row Level Security | data access per user/role |

### External services

| Service | Role |
|---|---|
| Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) | voice notifications per zone |
| Turf.js | geospatial calculations in Edge Functions |
| Vercel | PWA deploy |
| EAS Build | companion app builds + store distribution |

### Tooling

- TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier (shared config at root)
- Turborepo for build orchestration
- GitHub — single monorepo

## Dependency rules

```
apps/web/features/X    → can import from: apps/web/shared/, packages/shared/
apps/companion/features/X → can import from: apps/companion/shared/, packages/shared/
packages/shared        → can import from: nothing (zero dependencies on apps)
supabase/functions     → standalone Deno — no imports from packages/
```

Apps never import from each other. `packages/shared` never imports from apps.

---

## Auth flow — how both apps share identity

Both apps log in with the same Supabase credentials. Supabase returns the same JWT and `user_id` regardless of which app is used.

```
User logs in on PWA          → Supabase session (JWT stored in localStorage)
User logs in on companion    → same session (JWT stored in AsyncStorage)
Companion POSTs GPS coords   → Authorization: Bearer <JWT> → backend resolves user_id
PWA reads coords via Realtime → same user_id, same Supabase project
```

No bridge, no sync layer — Supabase is the single source of truth for both apps.

---

## Route protection

| Group | App | Access | Guard |
|---|---|---|---|
| `(auth)` | both | public | redirect if session exists |
| `(admin)` | web | admin only | redirect if role !== 'admin' |
| `(user)` | web | authenticated | redirect if no session |
| `(main)` | companion | authenticated | redirect if no session |

---

## Companion app — GPS pipeline

```
expo-task-manager background task
  ↓ receives GPS coords every ~30s
  ↓ POST /api/location  { lat, lng, userId }
  ↓ Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
Supabase Edge Function
  ↓ runs Haversine against active zones for user's group
  ↓ detects enter/exit state change
  ↓ inserts location_event
  ↓ triggers alexa-trigger or push-notify function
```

State change logic (enter/exit deduplication) runs server-side in the Edge Function — not on the device.

---

## Edge Functions — when to use

| Use case | Where |
|---|---|
| Trigger Alexa notification | Edge Function `alexa-trigger` |
| Send push to group members | Edge Function `push-notify` |
| Validate zone entry + deduplication | Edge Function |
| Read/write DB directly | Client via Supabase SDK (RLS handles security) |
| Format display data | Client |
